Python script to export IMDB public relational dataset

The IMDB relational dataset is a relational dataset stored in MariaDB and made available to the public. The prefered export tool for this dataset is MySQLWorkbench. However, this is currently not working. Which led to the creation of this script to export the data and DDL to .sql and .csv files. 

Information about this dataset can be found here: https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/IMDb
